## Project Description

**GhoomO** is a web application designed to help tourists make the most of their time exploring a city by providing optimal routes to the best tourist destinations under given time constraints. 

**How It Works:**

- Users enter the name of the city they wish to visit and the time they have available, along with their starting location.
- Upon user input, GhoomO's backend utilizes the TomTom Maps API to access distance data for all tourist sites stored in our database.
- The system then generates and presents the most efficient route for visiting these places within the given timeframe. 
- Users can further customize the route by including or excluding specific destinations.

GhoomO ensures that tourists can optimize their time spent exploring a new city, making their visit enjoyable and stress-free.
